#Introduction

This was my first foray into programming with C#. The objectives of the assignment were to create a database frontend, debug the program, and create a testing document.

The assignment was created in Visual Studio .NET Community 2017.

The .mdb database file needs to be saved to C:\Temp to direct the database connection to the correct location.

I really enjoyed this assignment, as creating this sort of business support software is where I see myself succeeding in my future career.
