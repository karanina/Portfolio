# Summary

This Yahtzee Game was designed for my Level 6 Data Structures and Algorithms Paper. 

### The learning outcomes for the assignment were:
1. Apply object-oriented design and implementation techniques.
2. Interpret the trade-offs and issues involved in the design, implementation, and application of various data structures with respect to a given problem.
3. Explain the purpose and answer questions about data structures and design patterns that illustrate strengths and weaknesses with respect to resource consumption.
4. Assess the impact of data structures on algorithms.
5. Analyse the scalability of data structures and algorithms in terms of both space and time complexity.

### Features of the Yahtzee Game include:
+ Balanced Binary Search Tree
+ Singly Linked List
+ Delegetes
+ Enums
+ SFML Library
